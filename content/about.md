### What is this

After watch a [video on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ce_Y3hyvHdo) about software engineer compensations i went through a research about this subject to understand better what could be the pros and cons about share info about our salary.

After a few researh and reading good things about share our salary with people around us and our coworkers, i got noticed that some people motivated by a [Zac Sweer's tweet](https://twitter.com/ZacSweers/status/1228205724255154177) started share your salary info on that thread.

Like spoken on the video above, i saw a big problem sharing these info on social media: security

### Why this

If you area a influent person and your twitter is most for business about your profession probably this reason don't apply to you. But if you are a normal person normally you will have a lot of closer people following you on your social media, like friends, colegues, neighbors, etc.

On a developed country with low criminal rates tell your salary to everybody could not be a problem to you. But for the most of people that live a different life in a poor country with high criminal rates, your neightbor know about your compensations could bring to you serious problem on the future. 

So i build these simple site - following Zac advice - to share with our community our salary and according to these info we can try to know how much we worth on the place that we are and eradicate a big problem in our area:

> *"Pay inequality is a big problem in tech, especially for underrepresented groups like women and minorities. The best way you can help is by sharing yours."*<br>
> â€” <cite>Zac Sweers[^1]</cite>

### Why use

We have different cost of living on each country and your salary should probably reflect this info. So to get a better idea of salaries i created an index based on your country cost of living. So a person that have a twice compensation than other but lives in a country with a twice cost of living should be the same index. See [Legend](/legend) to understand better.

Another thing that could help us to understand how much we worth and what is happening on the market is that these fields:

  
    degree  
    experience  
    position  
    location  
    type  

are taxonomies, so you can click and see only cards related to them, e.g, our contry, our city, our position.

If you click in the *More* button in a card, you can see a summary about how this person get on this position. It will help a lot if you are searching for a path for the same. 

I hope this info helps you in some way. 

Don't forget to [Contribute](/contribute) with your data to help other people as well. 

Thank you.
